tuentichallenge4
================

My solutions for the Tuenti Challenge 4 contest. Beware, not all of them are correct.

Most of them are Java sources in src/main/java, but there is one challenge solution (challenge 6) in Javascript,
in src/main/js.

The sources are complemented by the diary of my participation in the contest (in spanish), with the problems and challenges I
found and, mostly, the evolution of my state of mind... as such, the title is:

**"Diario de un developer yonki"**
